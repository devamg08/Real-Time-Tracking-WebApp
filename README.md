A device streams its GPS location to a Node.js server over Socket.IO,
and a Leaflet web map updates markers in real time.




✨ Features

📍 Live locations: Markers move instantly as devices report new coordinates

👥 Multi-device: Track multiple clients simultaneously

🗺️ Beautiful maps: Leaflet + OpenStreetMap tiles (no paid keys)

🧩 Simple API: Minimal socket events for send/receive location

🧭 Accuracy options: Choose frequency, distance threshold, and more

🧱 Room-based isolation (optional): Group devices by order/trip/tenant






🧪 Try it with two devices

Open the map on Device A (your phone).

Open the same link on Device B (laptop).

Move Device A → watch its marker update on both screens 🤩
